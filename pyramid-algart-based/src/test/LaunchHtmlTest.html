<!-- An example of calling the test -->
<p>Please create folder /pp-links/55e9afimageio/ and place there config.json with description of the pyramid,
for example:</p>
<pre>
    {
    "pyramidPath": "C:/Image/BIG/ImageIO/withPPJson",
    "renderer": {
        "format": "jpeg"
    }
}
</pre>
<p>withPPJson folder must contain 2 files:</p>
<ul>
    <li>data.tif - some image</li>
    <li>.pp.json - configuration file with the following minimal content:
        <pre>
    {
        "fileName": "data.tif",
        "formatName": "imageIO"
    }
        </pre>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Then start LaunchJavaTest.cmd. Note that the following JARs must present in the subfolder .m2:</p>
<pre>
algart-1.2.7.jar
grizzly-framework-2.3.22.jar
grizzly-http-2.3.22.jar

<!-- An example of calling the test -->
<p>Please start</p>
<pre>
    LaunchJavaTestGnu.cmd
</pre>
<p>Note: this cmd-file will copy the subfolders pp-links and pp-images into the root of your disk.</p>

<p><small>Also note: you need to have the following additional JARs from GNU library in .m2 subfolder:</small></p>
<pre>
    loci_tools-5.0.6.jar
    PlanePyramidSourceBioFormats.jar
</pre>
<p><small>You may use <code>LaunchJavaTest.cmd</code> to test without additional GNU JARs.</small></p>

<p>To add new image, please use</p>
<pre>
    AddImage.cmd someImage.jpg
</pre>
<p>for standard formats (jpg, png, gif) or</p>
<pre>
    AddImage.cmd someImage.svs -gnu
</pre>
<p>for pyramid formats supported by LOCI. The links to added images will appear at the end in the file</p>
<pre>
    <a href="pyramids.html">pyramids.html</a>
</pre>
<p>Initially, it can contain links to some already existing demo images.</p>

<p><b>Warning!</b> Please use the same disk drive for /pp-links, /pp-images folders and added images.
AddImage.cmd adds links to /pp-links and /pp-images at the <b>current</b> drive.</p>

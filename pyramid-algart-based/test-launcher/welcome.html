<body style="font-family: sans-serif">
<p>Please copy demo files to the correct place on your disk by the following cmd-file:</p>
<pre>
    CopyDemoFiles.cmd
</pre>
<p>This cmd-file will copy the subfolders pp-links and pp-images into the root of your disk.
    If it will fail due to insufficient permissions, please copy these folders into the root
    of the current disk manually.</p>

<p>Then please start the service by the following cmd-file:</p>
<pre>
    LaunchJavaServers.cmd
</pre>
<p>Note:</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>This cmd-file starts Java Machine via call</p>
<pre>
    java -Xmx8g -classpath %CP% net.algart.pyramid.standard.tests.OpenSourceImageFileAccessTest -gnu
</pre>
        <p>It means that java.exe <b>must be available in system paths</b>, and <b>it must be 64-bit</b> (not 32-bit).
            If this call fails, please replace &quot;java&quot; by the full path to the last installed 64-bit JRE,
            version 8 or higher, for example:</p>
<pre>
    "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_91\bin\java.exe" -Xmx8g -classpath %CP% net.algart.pyramid.standard.tests.OpenSourceImageFileAccessTest -gnu
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>This cmd-file should be started <b>only once</b>. Attempt to start this file 2nd time will fail
        with an error message &quot;java.net.BindException: Address already in use: bind&quot;.
        If you want to stop previously started service, please switch to the console window when it is started
        (usually with white text on black background) and click Ctrl+C.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <small>Also note: you need to have the following additional JARs from GNU library
                in <i>pp-config/lib/maven</i> subfolder:</small>
        </p>
<pre>
    loci_tools-5.0.6.jar
    PlanePyramidSourceBioFormats.jar
</pre>
        <p>
            <small>Usually this demo is distrubuted with these JARs. But if not, the cmd-file will start
                anyway, but only standard formats (jpg, png, gif) will be available for viewing.</small>
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>


<p>To add new image, please use</p>
<pre>
    AddImage.cmd someImage.jpg username
</pre>
<p>The user name can be any simple word, like &quot;Daniel&quot;, &quot;Anil&quot;, etc &mdash;
    it is just the name of subfolder in /pp-image folder where the images are added.
    The links to added images will appear at the end in the file</p>
<pre>
    <big><b><a href="pyramids.html">pyramids.html</a></b></big>
</pre>
<p>Please open this file! Initially, it can contain links to some already existing demo images.</p>

<p>Or please open ready <big><a href="html/PlanePyramidMultifileDemo.html">multifile demo page</a></big> with a list of some built-in pyramids.</p>

<p><b>Warning!</b> Please use the same disk drive for /pp-links, /pp-images folders and added images.
    AddImage.cmd adds links to /pp-links and /pp-images at the <b>current</b> drive.</p>
